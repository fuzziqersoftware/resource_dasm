# Things to do

## resource_dasm

- Build a regression testing framework with test cases for every resource type and every known decompressor
- Implement native-format returns for all resource types
  - Top priorities: ppat, DLOG, DITL, WIND, PAT, cicn, CNTL

### Code style

- Use StringReader in most places where we currently do pointer arithmetic
- Create some abstraction or consistent pattern for generating outputs based on multiple input resources (for example, generating the SONG JSON template or a .icns file from ICN#/icl4/icl8/etc.)

### Compression

- Are there any more ncmps in existence? resource_dasm currently only has System 0 and 2.

### Unimplemented/incomplete resource formats

#### Documented

- FOND
- ictb (IM: Toolbox Essentials, 6-159)
- mctb (IM: Toolbox Essentials, 3-156; there's a TMPL for this too)
- MOOV/MooV/moov
- ppat type 2 is not monochrome; it's RGB (see QuickDraw docs). Unclear if these are ever stored in resource forks though
- Should we add icm and kcs icons to .icns output files too? (kcs should be added as ics types, which could conflict)

#### Undocumented

- infa: TMPL from ResEdit appears incorrect
- POST: TMPL from ResEdit appears incorrect
  - whitefiles.org/mac/pgs/t02.htm: This is a PostScript outline font resource, which is usually of the PostScript Type 1 variety. If a particular style of a POST font is missing the Mac modifies the plain font. For example, it creates boldface characters by adding 30% to the width or oblique by slanting to the right by 15Â°.
- Tune: ScummVM appears to contain an implementation of Tune resources (https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/master/audio/midiparser_qt.cpp). It seems less complex than what resource_dasm does, though resource_dasm's implementation doesn't work well. Investigate this.

##### CREL/DATA

- CREL: looks like another form of CODE relocation info; there appear to be at least two different formats (see Realmz 5.1.6 vs. After Dark)
  - Another example: SimCity 2000 1.0 (in 1.2 they seem to have switched from Think C to CodeWarrior, as there's only a DATA resource, but no ZERO resource); here it looks like just a list of words pointing to offsets within the corresponding CODE
- DATA, ZERO and DREL are used by Think C to initialize the A5 world
- DATA without ZERO is used by CodeWarrior to initialize the A5 world

###### Think C / Think Pascal

Symantec's (THINK C, THINK Pascal) linker creates at least some of these: https://github.com/ksherlock/mpw/wiki/Symantec-Far-Model-CODE-Resources

> Q: I am writing a virus scanning program and I need to examine code resources of an application to verify that they are valid. What information does the Symantec Linker place in the first two bytes of the code resource?
>
> A: For all CODE segments besides CODE 0, there is a code segment header. The THINK Linkers use the upper bit of this header to indicate a model Far CODE segment. The runtime loader resides in CODE 1 of the application and is the first piece of code executed. The loader loads and initializes the DATA and STRS, installs hooks for \_LoadSeg, \_UnloadSeg, and \_ExitToShell traps, and calls the main program.
>
> If the code is using a far model, the \_LoadSeg and \_UnloadSeg bottlenecks completely replace the standard segment loader. The standard 4-byte CODE segment header is interpreted differently to accommodate the larger jump table, so it is incompatible with the ROM segment loader. The header has the following format:
>
> ```
> |15 |14                           0|
> |----------------------------------|
> |R  |Index of 1st Jump Table Entry |
> |F  |Number of Jump Table Entries  |
> |----------------------------------|
> ```
>
> The R bit indicates that the segment has relocations which must be applied at runtime. These are stored in a CREL resource with the same resource ID as the CODE segment. The F bit is used to distinguish a far header from the standard header.
>
> Be aware that this format is different from the header that MPW and Metrowerks use as well as the CFM-68K header format.

```

DATA + ZERO decoder:

```
u16* data = (pointer to DATA resource ID 0);
u16* zero = (pointer to ZERO resource ID 0);
u16* globals = CurStackBase;
u16* globals_end = CurrentA5;
while (globals < globals_end) {
  u16 d = *data++;
  *globals++ = d;
  if (d == 0) {
    // ZERO resource contains the amount of additional zero words
    for (u16 z = *zero++; z > 0; --z)
      *globals++ = 0;
  }
}
```

DREL decoder variant 1 (e.g. After Dark 3.0, Think Pascal 4.x):

```
u8* a5 = CurrentA5;
// Signed, not unsigned:
s16* drel = (pointer to DREL resource ID 0);
s16* drel_end = drel + (number of s16 in DREL resource ID 0)
while (drel < drel_end) {
  // Add A5 to jump table entry (positive offset [doesn't happen?])/global variable (negative offset)
  *((u32*) (a5 + *drel++)) += u32(a5);
}
```

DREL decoder variant 2 (Realmz < 7.x, SimCity 2000 1.0, Think C version 5+, Symantec C++ version 6+):

```
u32 strs = (address of STRS resource ID 0);
u32 a5 = CurrentA5;
// Signed, not unsigned:
s16* drel = (pointer to DREL resource ID 0);
s16* drel_end = drel + (number of s16 in DREL resource ID 0)
while (drel < drel_end) {
  s32 offset = *drel++;
  if (offset >= 0) {
    // Do not sign extend second value from DREL:
    offset = -((offset << 16) | *((u16*) drel)++);
  }
  u32 base;
  if (offset & 1) {
    // Pointer to string table
    offset &= ~1;
    base = strs;
  } else {
    // Pointer to global variable
    base = a5;
  }
  *((u32*) (a5 + offset)) += base;
}
```

Is it possible to recognize the DREL format by checking for positive s16? (yes: variant 2; no: variant 1)

CREL decoder:

```
u32 strs = (address of STRS resource ID 0);
u32 a5 = CurrentA5;
u8* code = (pointer to CODE resource ID n);
// Signed, not unsigned:
s16* crel = (pointer to CREL resource ID n);
s16* crel_end = drel + (number of s16 in CREL resource ID n)
while (crel < crel_end) {
  s16 offset = *crel++;
  u32 base;
  if (offset & 1) {
    offset &= ~1;
    base = strs;
  } else {
    base = a5;
  }
  *((u32*) (code + offset)) += base;
}
```

###### CodeWarrior

CodeWarrior's DATA format is completely different:

```
// DATA 0 resource layout:
//
// +---------------------------------+
// | long:   offset of CODE 1 xrefs  |---+
// +---------------------------------+   |
// | char[]: compressed init data    |   |
// +---------------------------------+   |
// | char[]: compressed DATA 0 xrefs |   |
// +---------------------------------+   |
// | char[]: compressed CODE 1 xrefs |<--+
// +---------------------------------+
```

Its usage along with a decompressor can be found in the source code of the CodeWarrior runtime (comes with CodeWarrior) in file `Appl68KStartup.c` for both 68k and 68k-CFM. PPC programs don't seem to use the DATA resource.

#### STRS

Think C string table. A list of combined C/P-strings, where each string is both prefixed by a length byte and suffixed by a zero byte. Unclear how strings longer than 255 characters are stored.

#### Custom formats used in multiple games/apps

- 'ADCR' encoding (used for some CODEs, including CODE 0)
- 'ajcp' compression/encryption (used in Zen and Prince of Darkness... is it a FutureBASIC thing?)
- hypercard_dasm fails horrendously on Spelunx and its secondary stacks (probably the stack format is intermediate)

#### Custom formats used in a single game/app

- Adventures of Billy: IMAG (header starts with 'AGFX' and 'ACPI' tags; Googling these is not helpful so probably will need some disassembling + delabeling)
- Avara: HSND (has header TMPL, but also uses a Huffman compression scheme with a fairly complex decoder. Avara is now open-source and the decoder implementation is at https://github.com/avaraline/Avara/tree/main/src/util/huffman)
- Bugs Bannis: Levels are fixed-size tilemaps, but the tile numbers don't align with the tilesheet PICT. Figure this out, or complete the remap table in bugs_bannis_render.
- DeadEnd: SNGV (seems to be a very simple sequence format; it has a TMPL even)
- Flashback PPSS: figure out what subset of the clut to use for each image set
- Marathon 1984: appears to contain yet another subformat of .256
- mondoBlobboDemo23: graphics seem to have a simple format with row offsets & custom bytewise compression; use vrfs_dump to get the files
- Oh No! More Lemmings: there are some minor offset issues still (see uppermost left horizontal pipe on Dangerzone)

## m68kexec

- Implement options like --load-pe but for PEFF, REL, and classic 68k executables
  - These are all relocated at load time; add a way to specify a preferred address in the CLI option

## m68kdasm

- Implement m68k assembler
- Fix PPC assembler/disassembler mismatch errors. Many of these are due to unused bits in the opcode (which are not represented in the disassembled output, so are re-assembled as zeroes).
  - 40000000 => 66781184 (0x3FB0000) mismatches
  - 4C000000 => 720352 (0xAFDE0) mismatches
  - 7C000000 => 4160136 (0x3F7A88) mismatches
  - EC000000 => 12316672 (0xBBF000) mismatches
  - FC000000 => 13252472 (0xCA3778) mismatches
- Add export symbols as labels in PEFF disassembly (this is tricky because they often point to transition vectors which are relocated at load time)

## realmz_dasm

- Localize things better in script disassembly (e.g. paste XAP disassembly into places where XAPs are referenced; paste complex encounter disassembly into complex_encounter opcodes, etc.)
- Handle the remaining unknown data formats. (Some already have structs defined and just need parsers/disassemblers to be written.)

## icon_unarchiver

- Support more icon archive formats, e.g. from the various tools the IconFactory has created over the years.

## smssynth

- 0xE2 sample incorrect (Monte Village)
- Late Ricco backdrop instrument incorrect
- Fix earlier instrument banks incorrectly shadowing later banks
- Implement sample envelope effects
- Disassemble original engine from Luigi's Mansion, Pikmin, or Super Mario Sunshine and verify smssynth's assumed behaviors
- Refactor smssynth to be more modular and merge with modsynth if possible
